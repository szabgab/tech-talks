## Notes

* How do you do your best work?
* Can your team learn to work better together? Do you believe that collaboration is a skill?
* Growth Mindset ([Carol Dweck, Mindset](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322))
* Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset
* Members of teams with fixed mindset don't want to challange each other, they are afraid to make mistakes infront of each other.
* Members of teams with growth mindset would outperform teams with fixed mindset.

* What new ways of working can you create together?
* Building new team habits (and rituals) What are the habbits now? What should be changed?


* Two Factors for effective teams:
    * Communication
    * Trust

**HOW you work together is more important than WHAT you are working on, and even WHO you are working with.**
* MIT Human Dynamic Lab - Harward Business review April 2010, ["The New Science of Building Great Teams"](https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-new-science-of-building-great-teams)
* The high performing, the most effective teams
    * Communicate frequently
    * Talk and listen in equal measure (no one person dominating)
    * Engage in frequent informal communication (Social channels as well)
    * Conversation is dynamic
* Google's [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/)
    * Impact of work
    * Meaning of work
    * Structure and clarity
    * Dependability
    * Psychological safety
* [Dr. Tasha Eurich](https://www.tashaeurich.com/) "Insight" - 95% of the people think they are self-aware, but only about 10-15% really are.
* Ivar Kroghrud team work user manual
* [Adam Bryant interviewing Ivar Kroghrud](https://bobmorris.biz/ivar-kroghrud-questback-in-the-corner-office)
* Self awareness:
    * When are yourmost productive hours?
    * When do you get your best ideas?
    * What does your ideal workday look like?

* Better Meetings and Workshops
* $37 billion is wasted on unproductive meetings in US every year
* Design your meetings:
    * What is the purpose of the meeting?
    * What is the best format for the meeting?
    * Meeting rhythms

* Google ventures anxiety parties

* [Braden Kowitz](https://kowitz.co/) Check-in rounds "The more honest we are with each other, the better we work together. And that's why check-in rounds are one of the best ways to get higher output from your team."
* Creating trust and psychological safety within the team.

* Asana's "No meeting wednesdays" - to get a long strech of uninterrapted time to get work done.

* Improve meetings by:
    * Have a facilitator - to step back and took an outside view of the meeting (a person who is not involved).
    * Make it dynamic (people stand up, use stickers, move things, not just sit around a table).
    * Give people time to think individually (some people, extroverts? will be quicker to speak up not giving time for others to think over the issue).
    * Decide what are youdoing in the meeting:
        * Ideas vs. Decisions
        * divergent thinking (idea generation) vs. convergent thinking (decision making)
        * You can't do them at the same time.

* Productive Conflict (People-based conflict is bad; Task-based, ideas-based conflict is excellent, but you need to create safe space for it)

1. Brainstorming session
1. Critical mode (let's challange each other)


* Team habbits (routines, rituals)
   * How you meet
   * How you share ideas
   * Social time
   * Alone time

* Etsy's Sharing mistakes - Phaidon [Failed it!](https://www.phaidon.com/store/general-non-fiction/failed-it-9780714871196/)

* How do you change behaviour?
* Bit by bit (1% change)
* Design - Test changes
