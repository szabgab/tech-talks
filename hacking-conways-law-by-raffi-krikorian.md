## Notes

* Speed - how fast can you develop your product
* At first everything is moving fast and then everything stops
* [Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
* How to split up a monolith (monrail) into Microservices
* "Setting up the teams says more about architecture than the architecture itself."
* If I put 4 people on a team you'll divide the project into 4 parts. If I give you 3 people, you'll divide it into 3 parts.
* [Organizationl chart]](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22Org_charts%22_comic_by_Manu_Cornet.png) of the 6 companies by [Manu Cornet](https://ma.nu/)
* "To solve technical problems, you often have to go outside the technical domain."
* Your team structure will accidentally dictate your architecture and how fast you can move.


0. It's not about the code!
1. Small teams can do big things. (Don't overstaff small groups.)
2. Full stack teams keep your architecture flexible.
3. Don't fight Conway's Law, work with it.
