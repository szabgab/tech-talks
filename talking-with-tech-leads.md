* "You want to be promoted" vs. "You are ready for a promotion".
* Hard things like expectations from other people.

* *Tech lead is not a promotion. It is a role change.*

The path:

* Junior Software Engineer
* Software Engineer
* Senior Software Engineer
* Tech Lead - seems like the next level in the career ladder, but it is not really.

There are 3 different ways to progress:

* Individual contributor (70-80% time spent on "executing, doing" e.g. designing, testing, coding)
* Management (70-80% time spent on "Managing the system" - supporting people, planning, budgeting, organising, add new skills to the team)
* Technical Leader (70-80 % of the time "Leading Technical Topics and teams", aligning team, technical risk management, technical vision, tech debt management, growing technical knowledge )

They all need differnt skilset.

"A Tech Lead is a software engineer, *responsible* for *leading* a development team, and responsible for the quality of its *technical deliverables*"

* Developer, Leadership, and Architecture Skills

* Tech leads deal directly with code about 30% of their time (coding or reading code)

## Surprises

* Feeling Alone (outside)
* Uncertainty (there are no right answers, binary habit, imperfect information)
* People are puzzling (people are unique, different strengths, archetypes, but no stereotypes!)

* When you have too much on your plate, instead of working hard to do them, you need to stop and plan.
* Try to delegate more.
* Being patient. (You can't go against the flow of the organization. Wait for the opportunity.)


* Develop Others
* Two techniques: Tell or Delegate


Tell => Sell (Why should they do the thing, motivate them)   =>  Particiapte (Work with them)   => Delegate


* Situational Leadership Model
    * Skill
    * Motivation
    * Urgency
