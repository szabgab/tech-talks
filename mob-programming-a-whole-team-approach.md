same computer.

## Notes

* Agile and eXtreme programming.
* It is like pair programming but with more people.
* "A continuous integration of ideas".
* Communication in real time.
* The team in the picture: 2 testers, product expert, database expert (dba), legacy code expert (who knows the projects in the company), 2 coding experts, and the manager.

* An excellent picture of a space flight control center where they mob-control.


### Why would we work this way?

* We learn together
* Removing the bottleneck
* Knowladge exchange
* Because the team decided to work this way.  Mob programming is voluntary by the team members because they feel can work better that way.

* "We are just having a meeting"

### Driver / Navigator - pair programming

* "For and idea to go from someone's head into the computer it must go through someone else's hands." - [Llewellyn Falco](https://twitter.com/llewellynfalco)

* instead of Driver / Observer which is the old-school way of pair-programming!



* The people who are doing the work can best determine how to do that work.

* Weekly Team Study And Practice Session

* "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable." Robert Henri

* People are in such a pressure to get the job done that they don't have time to figure out how to make it easy to get the job done.


* How can we work this way?
* Individuals and Interactions
* Kindness, Consideration, Respect


* [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista)


* What's the right number of people?
* How can you possibly me productive with five people sitting at one computer? I don't know? We just are. Is it imporant to know how? How can be production separating people to work on their own? Why do we assume that?

* "Transformation comes more from pursuing profound questions than seeking practical answers." - [Peter Block](http://www.peterblock.com/)
* A good question leads to a better question.
