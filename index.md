## Why?

You don't have a lot of time to go to conferences and even when you do, you spend the majority of your time in the
"hallway track" talking to other participants. Luckily many events record the talks and you can watch them later.
But which one and when? My goal is to provide you with a list of presentation recommended by other tech leaders
Not only that, but I watch each one of the presentations and add extensive annotations and links so you don't
have to track down the books and sites recommended during the presentations.

As for the when: During the day you have certain periods when you can focus less or when you feel you need
stretching. That's a perfect time to watch the videos.


## What are your favorite talks?

I know a few speakers and presentations that are worth adding to the list, but there a lot more I don't know.
I'd love to hear your recommendations. Specific presentations, a recommended speaker, or a recommended conference.
All are welcome. Feel free to contact me with your suggestions via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szabgab).
