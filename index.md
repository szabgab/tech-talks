## Do you have suggestions?

I know quite a few speakers and presentations that are worth adding to the list, but there a lot more I don't know.
I'd love to hear your recommendations. Specific presentations, a recommended speaker or a recommended conference.
All are welcome. Feel free to contact me with your suggestions via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szabgab).
