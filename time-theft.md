## Notes

### The five time thieves

* Unplanned work
* Neglected work
* Unknown dependencies
* Conflicting priorities
* Too much WIP (Work in Progress)


* WIP is a leading indicator
* [Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law)

### CIOs want

* More predictibility
* Less risk

* "We don't let our servers reach 100% capacity, why do we let people reach 100% utilization?"
